# Building a Personal GitHub Profile Page

## Project Overview
When you start talking to people in IT or cybersecurity, one question comes up faster than “Have you tried turning it off and back on?”  

**“What projects have you done, and where can we see them?”**

As someone new to the IT field, I learned pretty quickly that certifications are great, but employers really want to see **hands-on work**. This project documents how I built a **personal GitHub Pages website** to showcase my projects, labs, and learning journey — without paying for hosting or monthly fees (because I’m new to IT, not new to budgeting).

The result is a live, public portfolio site that proves I can build things, break things, fix things, and document the process without setting anything on fire.

## Objectives
- Create a professional, publicly accessible portfolio website
- Spend exactly **$0** on hosting
- Learn how GitHub Pages actually works (not just “click buttons and hope”)
- Gain hands-on experience with:
  - GitHub repositories
  - GitHub Pages
  - HTML and CSS
  - Git and version control
- Build something I can confidently show to employers without saying “please ignore that part”

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **GitHub** – version control and project hosting
- **GitHub Pages** – free static site hosting (thank you, internet gods)
- **HTML & CSS** – structure and styling
- **VS Code** – where mistakes were made and corrected
- **Git** – because “undo” only works so many times
- **Online documentation, tutorials, and AI assistance** – for when I stared at the screen and whispered “why?”

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account
I created a GitHub account at https://github.com and spent some time getting familiar with repositories, commits, and branches.

This step was important because GitHub would be doing double duty as:
- My **code repository**
- My **public portfolio platform**

Also, GitHub does not care about your feelings — but it *does* reward consistency.

---

### Step 2: Create the Portfolio Repository
To use GitHub Pages, the repository name must follow a very specific naming convention:

Example: richardpblair.github.io


This is not a suggestion. This is a rule. GitHub Pages is very polite, but very strict.

I initialized the repository with a README file and confirmed everything was created successfully.

---

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
Inside the repository settings, I navigated to:

- **Settings → Pages**
- Set the source to **Deploy from a branch**
- Selected:
  - Branch: `main`
- Saved the configuration

After a short wait (and at least one refresh), GitHub deployed the site and made it publicly accessible. No servers were harmed in the process.

### Step 4: Build the Website Using a Professional Template
Rather than starting from a completely blank page, I used the **MyPage template from BootstrapMade** as a starting point.

Using a pre-built template reflects real-world environments, where you’re often handed existing code and told, “Cool, now make it better.”

During this phase, I:
- Downloaded and extracted the MyPage template
- Reviewed the HTML and CSS to understand how the site was structured
- Customized content, sections, and layout to reflect my experience and projects
- Removed sections I didn’t need (because less clutter = fewer things to break)
- Adjusted styling and navigation for clarity and usability

All changes were made locally using VS Code and tracked with Git commits before being pushed to GitHub. Each push automatically redeployed the site using GitHub Pages, which made testing changes fast and mildly addictive.

This step gave me hands-on experience working with an existing codebase — something you do constantly in real IT and development roles.

---

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- One missing semicolon can ruin your entire afternoon
- Small HTML or CSS changes can have surprisingly dramatic results
- Git commit history is your best friend when something breaks
- Version control saves you from yourself
- AI tools are helpful, but understanding *why* something works is more important than copy-pasting fixes

I am not a web development expert — but I now understand how websites are structured, modified, and deployed without panic.

---

## Final Outcome
- A live GitHub Pages portfolio website
- A clean, professional place to showcase projects
- A repeatable workflow for adding future work
- Increased confidence using Git, GitHub, HTML, and CSS ( Still a long way to go )

Most importantly, this project allows me to **show my work**, not just talk about it.

---

## Next Steps
- Add additional projects and lab write-ups
- Improve design, accessibility, and responsiveness
- Include screenshots, diagrams, and technical explanations
- Continue breaking things safely and fixing them faster

---

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates:
- Initiative and self-directed learning
- Practical use of version control
- The ability to work with and customize existing code
- Clear technical documentation (with minimal crying)

For anyone starting in IT or cybersecurity, this is a low-cost, high-impact way to build a professional portfolio and stand out to prospective employers. So go out there. Build things. Break things. Fix them. Learn why they broke — and do it again. That’s how real IT skills are earned.
